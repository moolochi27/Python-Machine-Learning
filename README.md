# Python-Machine-Learning

This repository contains some of code I wrote as practice when studying SciKitLearn basics in Python. 

The goal of these practice files were to understand basic machine learning algorithms and practices, and how to modify and prepare real-life datasets for analysis. It should not be seen as a large scale project, but rather as a repetoire of algorithms that can be used in the future.
